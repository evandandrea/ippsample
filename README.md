# IPP Sample Implementations

[![Snap Status](https://build.snapcraft.io/badge/istopwg/ippsample.svg)](https://build.snapcraft.io/user/istopwg/ippsample)

This code provides sample implementations of IPP Clients, Printers, and Proxies.
It is largely based upon the [CUPS](https://www.cups.org/) software, with
substantial changes to the ippproxy and ippserver implementations to make them
more general-purpose and configurable.

## ippfind

The ippfind program implements Bonjour/DNS-SD discovery of IPP printers and can
be used to find and test specific printers.  Among other things, it is used as
part of the IPP Everywhere Printer Self-Certification test tools.

## ipptool

The ipptool program implements a generic IPP Client interface that allows a
user to send different IPP requests and act based on the response from the
Printer.  Among other things, it is used as part of the IPP Everywhere Printer
Self-Certification test tools.

## ippproxy

The ippproxy program implements a generic IPP Proxy interface that allows you to
connect a local IPP or PCL printer to an IPP Infrastructure Printer such as the
ippserver program.

## ippserver

The ippserver program implements a generic IPP Printer interface that allows you
to host shared printers using the IPP Shared Infrastructure Extensions as well
as support local printing or document processing.

## ipptransform

The ipptransform program is a generic file conversion utility that is used primarily with ippserver to support rasterization of JPEG and PDF documents for IPP Everywhere and HP PCL printers.
